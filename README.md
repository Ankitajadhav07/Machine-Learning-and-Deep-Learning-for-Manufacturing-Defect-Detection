# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-for-Manufacturing-Defect-Detection
This repository contains the implementation of an **automated defect detection system** designed for the manufacturing industry. The project leverages **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques to identify and classify defects, such as cracks, color spots, and missing components, in manufactured products.

## **Features**
- **Automated Visual Inspection**:
  - Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for defect classification.
  - Object detection models for localizing defects in product images.
- **Real-Time Processing**:
  - Lightweight architectures optimized for real-time inference using edge computing devices.
- **Scalability**:
  - Transfer learning capabilities to adapt the system to various product categories with minimal retraining.

## **Key Components**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation for robust model training.
2. **Defect Detection Model**:
   - Custom CNN architecture and pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, YOLO) for accurate defect identification.
3. **Real-Time Inference**:
   - Integration of TensorRT for fast, efficient model inference.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Matplotlib and OpenCV for displaying predictions and annotations on images.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deployment Tools**: Flask for API deployment, Docker for containerization
- **Hardware Compatibility**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi

## **How to Use**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankitajadhav/defect-detection.git
   cd defect-detection
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
